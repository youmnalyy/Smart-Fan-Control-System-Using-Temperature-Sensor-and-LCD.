This project focuses on controlling a fan based on 
temperature. A temperature sensor continuously 
monitors the environment, and the fan is 
automatically turned on or off depending on the 
measured temperature. This system helps maintain 
optimal temperature and saves energy by running 
the fan only when needed.
